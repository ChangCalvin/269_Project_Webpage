        <h3>Abstract </h3>
        
        <p>
        Facial feature points detection (FFPD) is an important task used in a multitude of applications including facial recognition, animation, tracking, expression analysis, and 3D modelling. In this report, we survey 7 well-established FFPD methods: Active Shape Models (ASM), Active Appearance Models (AAM), Active Template Models, (ATM), Active Contour Models, (ACM), Localized Region-based ACM (LACM), Supervised Descent Fitters (SDF), and Ensemble of Regression Trees (ERT). We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze their performance on the IBUG LFPW and 300W facial databases. We then show application of FFPD to the visual speech recognition task using two deep learning frameworks: a feature-only approach and a state-of-the-art end-to-end approach. Unfortunately, due to limited time and computational resources, we fail to effectively train the networks.
